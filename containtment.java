/**
 * Containment(composition) in JAVA
 * 
 * In JAVAprogramming language,
 * containment (also called as composition) is an 
 * object oriented programming concept where one 
 * class contains an object of another class as an number.
 * 
 * 
 * It represents a "has-a" relationship,
 * unlike inheritance which represents an "is-a"
 * relationship.
 * 
 * 
 * KEY POINTS ABOUT THE CONTAINMENT:
 * 1> Has-a relationship- A class has another class object.
 * 2> code reusabilty- instead of inheriting, you can reuse functionality.
 * 3> Flexibility- easier to change relationship compare to inheritance.
 * 4> Use in real objects- for ex. - a library contains books or a college contains departments, etc.
 *
